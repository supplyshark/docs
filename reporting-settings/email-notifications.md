# Email Notifications

SupplyShark will send notifications to the email address you entered during the onboarding process. On this settings page, you can modify the email address to receive vulnerabilities notifications to.

Some workflows might prefer to send these notifications to a team email address like `security@company.com`, so we created this as an option.

### Changing the reporting email

Browse to **Configure** -> **Email Notifications**, and update the email address.
