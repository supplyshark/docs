# Scan Frequency

On this settings page, you can modify how often you want SupplyShark to check for vulnerabilities.

Users with the Starter plan will only have the options to choose Weekly or Monthly. Pro and Premium users will have the option to choose Daily.

If SupplyShark hasn't analyzed your GitHub repositories yet, the next scan will be scheduled the next day.

## Setting the scan frequency

To set the scanning frequency:

1. Go to Configure -> Scan Frequency
2. Select Set Frequency and choose Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.
