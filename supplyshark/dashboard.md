You can view your scan frequency setting, when your last scan was run, and when SupplyShark is scheduled to run next.

There are also charts to see the number of vulnerabilities found over time.

## Scan history

Scroll to the bottom of the dashboard you can see the scan history starting from the latest.

This information includes the date SupplyShark scanned your repositories, how many results were found, and how many new results were found.
